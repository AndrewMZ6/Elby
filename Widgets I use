So I goiong to use next widgets of tkinter:

1. Button - for: close
                 evalute the payment
                 download data to DB
                 fetch from DB
                 
2. Label - for: last month textbar
                current month textbar
                rate (tariff)
                to pay
                
3. Entry - for: last month indication
               current month indication
               rate(tariff)
               
4. Listbox - for: choosing month to fetch data for


5. Text - for: displaying fetched data
