My app for electroenergy consumption calculation - GUI(tkinter) + Database(Sqlite3) + Python
I want my app to store data about my monthly electroenergy consumption
As an addition I want to pull out (extract) data for the past months 
So the functionality I want is this:
  1. adding current + past month indictions to existing database
  2. calculation of consumed energy and how much to pay for it
  3. fetching data of chosen month to be displayed
